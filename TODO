# Number ADFs staring from 1 (e.g ADF1, ADF2 etc.)
# Handle currentFile path for selecting files by path from MF
  (e.g. 00A40804067F105F3A4F3A)

>> KNOWN ISSUE <<
# ADF creation doesn't work for Gemalto v2.1 and Anritsu ISIM cards.
  INCORRECT_PARAMETER_IN_DATA_FIELD or INCORRECT_PARAMETERS_P1_P2 is returned.
  Many different combinations have been checked using:
  - Security Attribute Tag (8Bh)
  - PIN Status Template DO Tag (C6h)
  - DF_AID tag (84h) included in 'A5' tag
# Gemalto card doesn't support RESIZE_FILE command.
  It supports EXTEND command instead. Removing a file record is impossible.
